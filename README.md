# Mongoose Express Branch

This branch contains the codebase for the Mongoose Express phase of the MovieHub project. In this phase, we have implemented the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern to organize our codebase effectively.

## MVC Architecture

The MVC architecture separates the application into three interconnected components: Models, Views, and Controllers. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **Models:** Responsible for managing the data logic of the application. In this branch, we define our data models using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **Views:** Represent the user interface of the application. As this is a backend branch, views are not implemented here. Instead, the focus is on providing data and functionality to the frontend.

- **Controllers:** Act as intermediaries between the models and views, handling user requests and updating the models accordingly. Controllers in this branch manage the business logic of the application and handle HTTP requests and responses.

## MongoDB Atlas Cluster

In addition to implementing the MVC architecture, this branch utilizes MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed cloud database service, to host our MongoDB database. We have configured a cluster on MongoDB Atlas to store and manage our application data securely in the cloud.

Feel free to explore the codebase in this branch to understand how we've implemented the MVC architecture and integrated MongoDB Atlas into our backend infrastructure.
